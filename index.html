<p>

Gligs can have many legs.  Gligs with three legs are not Gligs, they
are called Glags.  Boubs have 30 legs, and are ancestors of Gligs.

</p>

<p>

Gligs live in many countries on Jupiter:

</p>

<ul>
  <li>Javagne</li>
  <li>Couchvagne</li>
  <li>Bavagne</li>
  <li>Ouvagne (in fact this is on Saturn)</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>

  Gligs have fought many world wars, ten world wars.  They won each time.
  They helped Ouvagne (on Saturn) in their war against Pluto.
