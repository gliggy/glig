<h1>Gligs</h1>

<p>

Gligs are a group of animals that live throughout the solar system and beyond. They have a complex family tree.

      $('body').css({'background': 'url(jupiter.png)', 'background-repeat':'no-repeat', 'background-size':'100% 100%'});
    }
    if (active==1) {
      $('body').css({'background': 'red'});
    }
    if (active==2) {
      $('body').css({'background': 'url(glig.jpg)', 'background-repeat':'no-repeat', 'background-size':'100% 100%'});
    }
    active = (active+1)%3;
    setTimeout(clignote,2000);
  }
  clignote();
});
</script>

</p>

<p>

Gligs can have many legs.  Gligs with three legs are not Gligs, they
are called Glags.  Boubs have 30 legs, and are ancestors of Gligs.

</p>

<p>

Gligs live in many countries on Jupiter:

</p>

<ul>
  <li>Javagne</li>
  <li>Couchvagne</li>
  <li>Bavagne</li>
  <li>Ouvagne (in fact this is both on Saturn and Jupiter)</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Gligs have fought many world wars, ten world wars.  They won each time.
  They helped Ouvagne in their war against Pluto.
    
</p>
  
<p>
   A glig is like a human child (although they are squishier and they cannot walk yet). <br> 
   They live in every continent, every ocean , on every moon, and on every leaf.  <br>
   There are hundreds of thousands of gligs in the world.  A glig cannot eat any more gligs. <br>
   They do not sleep because they need the sunlight to feed. <br>
   They have no eyes on their noses. Their eyes are on the top of their heads.  Their noses are not used for vision. <br>
   The tail is a bit long but not quite as long as their body. Gligs have spots that are  orange in color.
</p>

<p class="fancy">
  To reproduce 1 glig jumps in the belly of another and doubles! It is funny!
