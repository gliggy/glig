All About Gligs

This github page attempts to explain at least some some important details regarding gligs. Of course, it cannot expalain all of
the interesting facts out there. That is explained when we take a closer look at the amazing complexity of this seemingly 
simple animal. In fact, scientists are still in the process of trying do classify this strange and exotic animal. Last week, 
Leo, a pionneering scientist in the field, made a ground-breaking breakthrough! Did you know why gligs eat large quantities of
potatoes before launching themselves into space? As Leo's studies show, the main reason is to have enough fart gas to last them
the entire journey. Using a relatively simple chemical reaction in their stomach, the gligs convert the potatoes into a gas 
made up of 59 percent nitrogen, 21 percent hydrogen, 9 percent carbon dioxide, 7 percent methane and 4 percent oxygen. In other
words, they produce a fart that proppels them far into space.
